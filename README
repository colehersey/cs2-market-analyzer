# CS2 Market Analyzer

This project is a data-driven tool designed to analyze the historical and real-time market prices of CS2 (Counter-Strike 2) skins, knives, and gloves. The goal is to identify undervalued listings and predict price trends using data science and machine learning techniques.

The project focuses on:

- Fetching and storing CS2 market data from public APIs
- Building a structured local database (SQLite or PostgreSQL)
- Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on skin price trends
- Developing machine learning models to forecast price direction
- Deploying a system that helps users find profitable deals in real-time

This project is designed to be both a learning tool and a functional prototype for personal or semi-automated trading assistance.
